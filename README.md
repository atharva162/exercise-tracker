A full stack JavaScript Application build with NodeJs, ExpressJs and MongoDB(for database) that keeps record of the user's exercise sessions.

### Steps to run this repo:-

2.Upon heading to your favourite Code Editor run this command into the terminal ```npm install``` to install all the required dependencies.

3.When all the required dependencies are installed, run ```npm run start``` in the terminal to start the development server, the API will start running in the port 3000, to view it go to the following URL "http://localhost:3000".

4.Create a .env file and add a variable named URI and add your Mongodb connection url, as by doing this the short URLs will be directly saved into your database. Now you can start making requests to the API endpoints.
